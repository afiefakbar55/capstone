# Car Rent Database Capstone Project by Afief

My first ever capstone project for reading, creating, modifying, and deleting Car Rent Order Data using Python Basic Syntax.

## Motivation

In order to fulfill the basic training using python basic syntax, I was asked by lecture to create this mini project to explore more about Python in depth.

## Data and Method

I use nested dictionary data to store the database because it is easier for me to access the data for each key(Order id).
I created several function to simplify the syntax of my program such as printing each data, checking the data and so on.

## Creator

This is created by Zul Afief Akbar.
